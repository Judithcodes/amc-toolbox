# amc-toolbox
MATLAB toolbox for automatic modulation classifier development

This repository is release along with my book on automatic modulation classifier titled "Automatic Modulation Classification: Princples, Algorithms, and Applications". The companion website is avaliable at: http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118906497.html.

For copyright reasons, my co-author and I have agree to release only the encrpted MATLAB files for the classifier source codes. However, the demo files should provide a good idea how some of this function can be used for AMC problems.

I have though about porting the toolbox to a python package. The realization of this idea has no definite time scale at this moment.
